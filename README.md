# Railway-Database
The SQL Railway database is designed to manage and organize information related to railway operations. It includes several interconnected tables to store data about users, passengers, trains, and stations. The users table holds personal information about users such as their names, contact details, and addresses. The Passenger table records travel details for each passenger, including their booking status, seat allocation, and travel itinerary. The train table provides information about various trains, including their names, types, number of coaches, and fare. The station table lists the stations where trains stop, detailing their halt durations and arrival times. This relational database structure ensures efficient handling and querying of railway data, facilitating smooth operations and better management of travel schedules and passenger information.
